      <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
      <p>Thank you for stopping by my page. I will try my best to briefly give you an idea of who I am and what I like.</p>
      <h1>I am from Northern Virginia.</h1>
      <p>I lived in Northern Virginia for over 20 years. The winters season can get cold. 
        We usually get snow every year. There is a big diversity of people from all of the country 
        that live in Northern Virginia. In Northern Virginia you will find excellent universities withing a close distance of each other.
         Unfortunately, people are not as friendly as people from Georgia.
      </p>
      <h1>My favorite hobbies are reading, and learning new pranks.</h1>
      <p>Employees from my previous job love how I perk up their
         day by performing pranks.</p>
      <h1>My dream job is to be a detective.</h1>
      <p>Unfortunately the hours are long and you can get called to work without any
        notice. Due to their busy schedule trying to solve cases they don't have 
        that much time to spend with their family. That is why I can't pursue that path.
      </p>
      <h1>I live in Cumming, GA</h1>
      <p>Cumming is a city that is about 30 minutes outside of Atlanta, Ga. In Cumming, the schools have high scores and people are real friendly.</p>
      <h1>I would like to be a web developer. </h1>
      <p>I would like to become a web developer because I find it interesting how just 
        by writing codes people can create a cool website. I would like to 
        create apps. I also like that you could work from home 
        and not have to deal with traffic.
