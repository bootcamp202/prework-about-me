      <h1>Welcome to my page.</h1>
      <p></p>
      <h1>I am from Northern Virginia.</h1>
      <p>I lived in Northern Virginia for over 20 years. </p>
      <h1>
        My favorite hobbies are reading, and learning new pranks. 
      </h1>
      <p>Employees from my previous job love how I perk up their day by performing pranks.</p>
      <h1>My dream job is to be a detective.</h1>
      <p>Unfortunately the hours are long and you can get called to work
         without any notice. Due to their busy schedule trying to solve cases 
         they don't have that much time to spend with their family. That is why I can't pursue that path.</p>
      <h1>I live in Cumming, GA</h1>
      <h1>I would like to become a web developer.</h1>
      <p> I think it is interesting how by just writing codes people can create a cool website. I would like to create apps. 
        I also like that I could work from home and not have to deal with traffic.</p>
